# Real Estate Consigliere - Business Plan (Bulletproof)

## The Opportunity
- **Singapore market:** Property agents rely heavily on WhatsApp + Google Calendar
- A $4k/mo PA can be replaced by AI at 80% cheaper
- Non-technical clients want plug-and-play: "pay and forget"
- Target: Individual agents + agencies with multiple PAs

---

## MVP Features (Singapore-Optimized)

### Core (Must Have for Launch)
1. **WhatsApp Integration**
   - Auto-responder when agent unavailable
   - Lead capture & qualification via WhatsApp
   - Meeting booking via WhatsApp (client suggests times, Consigliere confirms)
   - Broadcast messages to client lists

2. **Google Calendar Sync**
   - Auto-schedule showings/meetings
   - Conflict detection
   - Availability management

3. **Simple Dashboard**
   - See conversations, schedule, leads in one view
   - No jargon - just "what's happening now"

### Tier 2 (Month 2)
4. **CRM Integration** (PropertyGuru, 99.co)
5. **Lead Follow-up Automation**
6. **Market Alerts** (new listings matching client preferences)

### Tier 3 (Month 3+)
7. **Voice Receptionist** (incoming calls)
8. **Document Automation**

## Pricing Strategy

### For Individual Agents
| Tier | Price | Value |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Soldier** | $199/mo | WhatsApp auto-reply + basic scheduling |
| **Capo** | $349/mo | + Calendar sync + CRM + lead capture |
| **Consigliere** | $499/mo | + Voice calls + market research |

### For Agencies (B2B)
| Seat Type | Price | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **AI PA Seat** | $249/mo | Per agent/assistant |
| **Agency Pack** | $999/mo | Up to 5 seats |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Unlimited + dedicated support |

**Setup Fee:** $0 during beta (later: $299)

**The Pitch:** "Your PA costs $4k/month. My AI does 80% of her work for $349. That's $3,650 savings every month."

---

## Sales Strategy

### The Hook
Don't sell "AI" — sell the savings and freedom:
- "What if you could keep your clients happy 24/7 without paying $4k/month?"
- "Your PA handles 5 clients. My AI handles 50."

### The Process
1. **Warm intro** (your network) → Free 7-day trial
2. **Show, don't tell** — Let them see it in action on WhatsApp
3. **Capture feedback** — Tweak, then lock pricing
4. **Referral incentive** — "Give us a client, get 1 month free"

### Key Objection Handling
- **"I already have a PA"** → "Great, let the AI handle the boring stuff so your PA focuses on closing deals. She'll thank you."
- **"What if it messes up?"** → "There's a human (me) overseeing it. Plus it's 80% cheaper, so even if it's 90% as good, you win."

| 1-2 | Build MVP (WhatsApp + Calendar + Dashboard) |

| 7 | Refine pricing, launch publicly |
| 8+ | Scale + B2B outreach |

## Greenlight Needed On:
1. **Is $199-499/mo the right range for SG agents?**
2. **Should we offer B2B pricing from Day 1 or wait?**
3. **Free trial length: 7 days or 14 days?**
4. **Do we need a contract/l_terms for beta?**
